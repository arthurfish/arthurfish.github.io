30% for quizzes

60% for tests (T1 25%, T2 25%)

4 credits = 200 min in a week

minimum 400 min  <- out of dats in a week.

The most important rule is -- WHEN A SENTENCE/ WORD IS NOT UNDERSTAND, STOP ME AND ASK TO EXPLAIN AGAIN.

"The explain is my job, to understand is your job."

VERTICAL LINE TEST

SYMMETRIC function

About y-axis

​		-> even function (x^2, x^4, x^4)

w.r.t = with respect to

w.r.t origin / or (x=y)

​	->odd function (x^3, x^5,  ... x^{2n+1} )

Domain of a function

Range of a function

Conposit function: f(g(x) =   f o g(x)  -> f of g of x

x~y y~x ('~' use to relation)

g o f(x) = I(x) = x, and

f o g(y) = I(y) = y  <-- Identity function

f o f^{-1} = f^{-1} o f = I
